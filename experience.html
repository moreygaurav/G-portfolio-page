        I heve experience of Working in teem as well as solo.
        Most of the experience i've gaind is from working on solo projects by my own some of my project wer <a href="/pong pong game in python first game.py"> <b>Pong-Pong game in python</b></a> and <a href="/student management system"> <i>student management system</i></a>
    
        And all this project wer in python, because python was the first language that ive lurnd and ive licked while studing language.
            Other than that 'my protfolio page ' is the another program that ive worked on and built by my self but this program is not in python otherthan python this program is in HTML language and ive write this program while i was studing HTML language by myself.
